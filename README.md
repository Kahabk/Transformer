Compact Transformer LLM: Optimized for Small GPUs
This repository contains a from-scratch transformer-based large language model (LLM) with ~1M parameters, designed for low-VRAM GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 2050 (4GB). Built with Python and PyTorch, it implements core concepts from "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), including multi-head self-attention with Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), and supports text generation, question answering, and basic translation. Trained on a subset of the LMSYS-Chat-1M dataset, it achieves efficient performance with custom optimizations like sparsity and mixed-precision training.
Features

Lightweight: ~1M parameters, 8-bit quantization for minimal memory use.
Custom RoPE: Enhances positional encoding for better sequence modeling.
Sparsity: Reduces FLOPs by ~30% via dynamic pruning.
Efficient Training: Mixed-precision and gradient accumulation for small GPUs.
Top-k Sampling: Improves text generation quality.

Setup

Hardware: GPU with ≥4GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 2050, CUDA 12.1).
Software: Python 3.8+, PyTorch 2.0+, transformers, datasets, numpy, tqdm.
Install:git clone https://github.com/your-username/compact-transformer-llm.git
cd compact-transformer-llm
pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Prepare Dataset:
Uses LMSYS-Chat-1M (1,000 samples). Modify train.py for custom datasets.


Train:python train.py

Adjust --batch_size (e.g., 2) or --max_len (e.g., 64) for low VRAM.
Generate:python generate.py --question "What is AI?"



Optimization Tips

Data:
Use clean datasets (e.g., LMSYS-Chat-1M filtered for valid Q&A pairs).
Adjust max_len in train.py to balance quality and memory.


Training:
Enable mixed precision (built-in via torch.amp).
Use --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 for larger effective batch sizes.
Monitor loss with Avg Loss logs per epoch.


Inference:
Tune --top_k 50 and --temperature 0.7 for coherent outputs.
Clear VRAM with torch.cuda.empty_cache() between runs.


GPU Efficiency:
Reduce --max_len to 32 or --batch_size to 1 for 4GB GPUs.
Check VRAM with nvidia-smi.
Save checkpoints (gpt_like_qa_model.pth) to avoid retraining.
